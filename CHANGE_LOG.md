Solid mobs change-log

## v1.2
- dead or dying entities no longer have collisions fixing incompatibility with fast mob farms
- setting to allow invisible entity collisions *(disabled by default)*
- item frame and painting collisions now disabled by default
- fall damage transferred to a fallen upon entity now registers to the victim as an attack from the faller *(e.g. hurting zombie-piglins in this way will trigger their hostility)*
- added Allays to the pet collision exemption list in 1.19 version
